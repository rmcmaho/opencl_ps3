\begin{abstract}
Programming for the Playstation 3 (PS3) is notoriously difficult due, in part, to its Cell Broadband Engine (Cell/B.E.).
Code must be written using the Cell SDK, which is useless on any other platform. Yet the system is incredibly powerful.
The current fastest computer in the world, Roadrunner, utilizes the Cell/B.E. to great effect.
The PS3 has become popular as a cheap supercomputer, but programmers are reluctant to port their code or even write new code.
OpenCL (Open Computing Language) seeks to solve this problem by providing a framework for parallel programming on heterogeneous systems.
OpenCL allows code to run on any architecture or device that supports the framework.
IBM has said a Cell/B.E. implementation is "in the works", but there is no hint as to when it will be available.
I aim to implement atleast a minimal subset of OpenCL for the Cell/B.E., allowing basic programs using OpenCL to run on the PS3.
