This project deals primarily with parallelism transparency.
Tasks can be run on multiple devices and in parallel
with little involvement from the programmer and zero
involvement from the user. Without OpenCL, programmers
would have to explicitly control parallel tasks. They
would also have to write code designed for a specific
type of architecture, whether it be a CPU, GPU, or some
other processor. 

With OpenCL, programmers are freed from these constraints.
They do not have to worry so much about specifics of
parallelism and architecture. The underlying hardware
can change and their software will still operate, given
that the hardware supports OpenCL. Users would also not have to worry
about downloading different binaries. Instead of
a binary for CPUs, one for GPUs, and one for both,
the user can just get one binary which will automatically
detect any available OpenCL compatible devices.
