As stated earlier, there are no announced plans from
IBM regarding a PS3 implementation of OpenCL. If successful,
this would not only be the first PS3 implementation but
the first available and functional implementation.
To my knowledge, there are, as yet, no other implementations
of OpenCL. The developer releases of Apple's ``Snow Leopard''
have an implementation~\cite{applepr}, but those are not publicly available.
NVIDIA's implementation is also still under development~\cite{nvidiapr}~\cite{nvidiademo}.
I believe I can do this because I have done prior
research on both the Cell/B.E. and high performance,
parallel computing. I plan to release this under 
GPLv3 so that in the event IBM releases an official implementation,
there will still be a free and open-source version.
